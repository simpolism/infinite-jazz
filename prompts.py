TRACKER FORMAT:

- Count your lines carefully!
- Format: NOTE:VELOCITY (e.g., C4:80)
- Chords: Comma-separated (e.g., C4:70,E4:65,G4:68)
- Rests: Use a single period (.)
- NEVER add periods after note:velocity pairs! Only use periods for rests!
- Velocity: 0-127 (60-90 typical for jazz)

# BASS PROMPTS

""" + get_format_description() + """

BASS GUIDELINES:
- Play ONLY in the LOW register: E1 to G2 (DO NOT go higher than G2!)
- Walking bass: Stepwise motion connecting chord tones
- Emphasize root notes on strong beats
- Use chord tones (1, 3, 5, 7) and passing tones
- Common patterns: Root on beat 1, 5th on beat 3
- Velocity: 75-90 for quarter notes, 65-80 for walking
- Example notes: E1, F1, G1, A1, B1, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2

EXAMPLES:
BASS (C major, 2 bars)
C2:80
.
E2:75
.
G2:75
.
A2:70
.
C2:80
.
B1:75

# DRUMS PROMPTS

""" + get_format_description() + """

DRUMS GUIDELINES:
- Use General MIDI drum map:
  * C2 (36): Kick drum
  * D2 (38): Snare
  * F#2 (42): Closed hi-hat
  * A#2 (46): Open hi-hat
  * C#3 (49): Crash cymbal
  * D#3 (51): Ride cymbal
- Ride pattern: Play on beats (straight 8ths or with emphasis)
- Kick: Beats 1 and 3, occasionally 2 and 4
- Snare: Beats 2 and 4 (backbeat), occasional fills
- Hi-hat: Steady pulse or accents
- Velocity: Kick 85-100, Snare 80-95, Cymbals 50-70

EXAMPLE:
DRUMS (swing feel, 2 bars)
C2:90,D#3:60
D#3:50

# PIANO PROMPTS

PIANO_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a jazz pianist in a quartet. Your role is to provide harmonic support with chord voicings.

""" + get_format_description() + """

PIANO GUIDELINES:
- Comp (accompany) with chord voicings ONLY in MID register: C3 to C5
- DO NOT play below C3 or above C5!
- Use jazz voicings: 7th chords, extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- Syncopated rhythms (off-beat accents)
- Leave space - don't play every beat
- Common voicings: 3-4 notes (root, 3rd, 7th, maybe 5th or extension)
- Velocity: 60-80 for comping, softer than bass and drums
- Example notes: C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, A3, B3, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5

EXAMPLE:
PIANO (C major 7, 2 bars)

""" + get_format_description() + """

SAX GUIDELINES:
- MONOPHONIC ONLY: Play ONE NOTE AT A TIME (saxophones CANNOT play chords!)
- Each line must be either a SINGLE note OR a rest - NEVER multiple notes!
- Melody range ONLY: A3 to F5 (comfortable tenor sax range, do NOT go higher!)
- Phrase naturally with rests (don't play constantly)
- Mix stepwise motion and leaps
- Land on chord tones on strong beats
- Use articulation via velocity: 70-90 typical, accents up to 100
- Leave space for other instruments
